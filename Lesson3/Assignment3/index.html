            <h1>Mustafa Basil Albayati</h1>
            <h2>Photographer / filmmaker</h2>

            <p>Mustafa Basil is a photographer and filmmaker based in Raleigh, North Carolina. His passion never gets old enough and tired, started back in 2008 as a guitar player, played many gigs, and formed four rock/indie rock bands. Until 2016 when he moved to the United States, his motivation for music became less than before. He started to look for new things to adopt, thought about pursuing a career in aviation. However, plans did not work, then settle down for major in advertising and graphic design. Later in 2016, Mustafa found himself holding a camera and remembered his childhood when he was filming family vacations with Sony Dcr-DVD camcorder. Funny to say that his first wedding film was in 2005, he was just 11 years old. He filmed couple of shots for his cousin wedding. Before that was the SURE SHOT film camera Series. Mustafa starts learning digital photography, which was far from his passion, and the more he learned about it, the more he fell in love with it. Today Mustafa is specialized in commercial content for brands, filming weddings and short films, and also teaches filmmaking and photography on YouTube. Late 2018 he started his first production company named “ERAPICK LLC.” Throughout the phase of learning photography, Mustafa won first place for student applied benchmark contest at Wake Tech college for the best content production project. </p>
